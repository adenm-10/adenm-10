## Hello everyone!

Hello, my name is Aden McKinney, and I'm currently an Honors Computer Engineering Student at UCF, as well as the projects chair for IEEE UCF! I am open to any
potential opportunities for me personally and IEEE UCF, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in any of my projects.

The best way to reach me is by email: 

aden.mckinney10@gmail.com

ieee@ucf.edu

I'm interested in all forms of Software Engineering, but lately I've been diving into Machine Learning and Data Analysis, so again, feel free to reach out if you have 
questions about me, IEEE UCF, think you could help me or the club out, or just want to chat!
